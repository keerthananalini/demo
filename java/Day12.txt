Day-12
-------

final
------
Variables - we cannot change the value of variable ( constant)
methods - we cannot override methods in the child class
classes - we cannot extend the class in to another class

Data Abstration

Interface
-------------
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details 
and showing only functionality to the user.

Interface
-------------
An intgerface is a blue print of class.
Interface contains final & Static variables.
Interface contains abstract methods.( also allowed default methods & Static methods from java8 onwards)
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body(Un-implemented method).
Methods in interface are public.
Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
We can define interface with interface keyword.
A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but aÂ class implements an interface.
We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
