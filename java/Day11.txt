-------
Inheritence
----------------

Aquiring all the properties(Variables) & behaviour(methods) from one class to another class is called inheritance.

class  A--- varaibles & methods

class B --- variables & methods


class B extends A
{
}

A  - Parent / Super/ Base
B - Child /Sub /Derived

objectives
-----
1) re-usability
2) avoid duplication

types
----------
1) Single
2) Multi level
3) Hierarchy
4) Multiple 


Object --- root class of all the classes

overriding

Method Overriding:
---------
1) Possible only in  Multiple classes/inheritance.
2) We should NOT change the definition of the method but body we should change.
3) method names are same
4) Related to inheritence

Method Overloading
-------------------
1) Possible in Single & Multiple classes/inheritance
2) We should change the definition of the method
3) method names are same.
4) Related to polymorphism

super
---
1) super keywork invokes immediate parent class variable
2) super keyword invokes immediate parennt class method
